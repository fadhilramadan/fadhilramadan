<h1 align="center">Why hello there! 👋</h1>

I’m Fadhil, a **business strategist in training** by day, a **curious coder** since childhood, and a **hypothetical Marvel superhero** whose identity is so classified, even my Avengers membership card got lost in the mail.  

I wrote my first line of code on a **Windows XP machine** (which I’m pretty sure still runs someone’s nuclear power plant) before I learned to tie my shoes. These days, I’ve upgraded to **Linux** — because adulthood means choosing your own kernel, right?  

## 🏆 Notable "Pro" Moves  
- Taught myself `for` loops while my peers learned the alphabet. *(Alphabet is overrated anyway.)*  
- Convinced my management class that “agile methodology” is just *group projects with extra caffeine*.   
- Used machine learning to predict sales of **SIDO** during *pancaroba*… accuracy: *”more reliable than the BMKG”*
- Explained quantum computing to my cats. *They pretended to care.*
- Turned my old *MiFi router* into a Linux server. It now hosts a blog about *why Indihome deserves a competitor*.
- Named all my variables after Marvel characters. *`thanos.snap()` still gives me PTSD.*  


## 🤝 Let’s Connect!  
Whether you’re here to geek out over behavioral economics, debate `tabs vs. spaces`, or just admire my commitment to commenting code in broken Bahasa Indonesia — **let’s make magic** (or at least a functional MVP) !
